This is a plan from https://github.com/ontologyportal/sumo/issues/61
We create a couple of terms to simplify each demonym:

(subclass NationalPerson GroupOfPeople)
(instance DemonymFn UnaryFunction)
(domain DemonymFn 1 GeographicArea)
(rangeSubclass DemonymFn GroupOfPeople)
(documentation DemonymFn EnglishLanguage "A &%GroupOfPeople defined by their &%birthplace or where the &%Residence they &%inhabit is &%located.")

(=>
(instance ?P (DemonymFn ?N))
(or
(exists (?R)
(and
  (located ?R ?N)
   (inhabits ?P ?R)))
(birthplace ?P ?N)))

Then we  create the tedious file that starts as follows:
(there are (vcvp believes) noun.person (8535) that have "a native or inhabitant of", 
of which (4860) have no translation in Portuguese.  the task is not as small as gentilics)
%--------------------

(equal NewZealander (DemonymFn NewZealand))
(equal NewYorker (DemonymFn NewYork))
(equal Brazilian (DemonymFn Brazil)) 

(equal  Frisian (DemonymFn Frisia))
