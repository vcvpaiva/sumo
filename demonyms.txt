This is a plan from https://github.com/ontologyportal/sumo/issues/61
We create a couple of terms to simplify each demonym:

(subclass NationalPerson GroupOfPeople)
(instance DemonymFn UnaryFunction)
(domain DemonymFn 1 GeographicArea)
(rangeSubclass DemonymFn GroupOfPeople)
(documentation DemonymFn EnglishLanguage "A &%GroupOfPeople defined by their &%birthplace or where the &%Residence they &%inhabit is &%located.")

(=>
(instance ?P (DemonymFn ?N))
(or
(exists (?R)
(and
  (located ?R ?N)
   (inhabits ?P ?R)))
(birthplace ?P ?N)))

Then we  create the tedious file that starts as follows:
(there are (vcvp believes) noun.person (5791) that have "a native or inhabitant of" and are noun.person, 
of which (3077) have no translation in Portuguese.  the task is not as small as gentilics)
