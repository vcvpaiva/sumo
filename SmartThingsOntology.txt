(subclass smartDevice ElectricDevice)
(documentation SmartDevice EnglishLanguage 
"A SmartDevice is a type of ElectronicDevice, generally connected to other devices or networks via different wireless protocols, 
that can operate to some extent interactively and autonomously.") 

;; many home appliances have smart analogues such as smart speakers (Alexa, GoogleHome, etc) and smart tvs
