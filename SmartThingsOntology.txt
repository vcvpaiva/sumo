;; Description:  This describes concepts related to smart devices, especially the ones in
;; https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/docs/devices/working-with-bixby.html.
;; But the goal is to deal with all the devices/capabilities in the OCF, Open Connectiviy Foundation
;; https://openconnectivity.org/developer/specifications
;; 
;; Ontology dependencies for SmartThings.kif: 
;; Merge.kif
;; Mid-level-ontology.kif,
