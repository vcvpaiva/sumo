;; air conditioner 
;; see http://sigma.ontologyportal.org:8080/sigma/Browse.jsp?flang=SUO-KIF&lang=EnglishLanguage&kb=SUMO&term=AirConditioner
;; (subclass AirConditioner ElectricDevice)
;; (documentation AirConditioner EnglishLanguage "AirConditioner is a type of ElectricDevice that is designed 
;; to provide comfort during hot or cold weather by keeping the air in an area a specific temperature")
;; has purpose and is part of the hotel ontology
;; (subclass AirConditioner ElectricDevice)

;; (documentation ElectricDevice EnglishLanguage "A Device that uses Electricity as its primary power source.")
;; (subclass ElectricDevice Device)

(subclass smartDevice ElectronicDevice)
(subclass smartDevice ElectricDevice)
(documentation ElectronicDevice EnglishLanguage "An electric Device where the main functionality is provided by electronic circuits.")

;; Air Purifier  to be added
(subclass AirPurifier ElectricDevice)
;; air purifier (Q1196206) wikidata
(documentation AirConditioner EnglishLanguage 
"AirPurifier is a type of ElectricDevice that is designed to  remove contaminants from the air in a room to improve indoor air quality.")

;; smartDevice  to be added
(subclass smartDevice ElectricDevice)
(documentation SmartDevice EnglishLanguage 
"A SmartDevice is a type of ElectronicDevice, generally connected to other devices or networks via different wireless protocols, 
that can operate to some extent interactively and autonomously.") 

;; many home appliances have smart analogues such as smart speakers (Alexa, GoogleHome, etc) and smart tvs
(subclass smartSpeaker SpeakerDevice)
(subclass smartTV TelevisionSet)
;; 	Mid-level-ontology.kif 22993-22993 	Mobile cell phone is a subclass of receiver device
;; (subclass MobileCellPhone Telephone)
(subclass  SmartCellPhone MobileCellPhone)

;; (subclass ClothesWashingMachine MajorAppliance) 	 	Clothes washing machine is a subclass of major appliance
;; (subclass ClothesWashingMachine WashingDevice)
(subclass SmartWashingMachine ClothesWashingMachine)

(subclass SmartDoorLock DoorLock)
;; (documentation Lock EnglishLanguage "A Device, which, through a Key or a combination prevents access to a Container or StationaryArtifact.")
;; (subclass Lock SecurityDevice)
(subclass DoorLock Lock)
(documentation DoorLock EnglishLanguage "A Device, which, through a Key or a combination prevents access via a Door to a Container or StationaryArtifact.")
;; (documentation Door EnglishLanguage "An Artifact that restricts and permits access to a StationaryArtifact (e.g. Building or Room) depending on whether the Door is open or locked. Note that the class Door also covers gates, because it is not possible to define objective criteria that reliably distinguish doors from gates.") 	 	
;; (subclass Door Device)

;; (documentation LightFixture EnglishLanguage "Any Device whose purpose is to be a source of visible light.") 	
;;( subclass LightFixture Device)
;; (subclass ElectricLightFixture LightFixture)
(subclass smartElectricLight LightFixture)
(subclass smartElectricLight SmartDevice)

;; (subclass Accelerometer Sensor)  (good!)
;; (subclass Sensor ComputerHardware) bad, as  a sensor that measures moisture does not need to be computer hardware
